In Western riding, the rider sits in a Western saddle with the horse’s head facing the horse’s direction of travel. The Western rider uses the reins to communicate with the horse and uses their legs to shift their weight and move around in the saddle. This riding style is best for people who love to be active, feel comfortable being in a forward position, and want to participate in a hands-on form of equestrian competition.Western riders are usually comfortable in Western-style saddles, as well as Western-style boots that cover the ankle. Western boots are heavier, with thicker soles, than Western-style riding shoes; but they are still less protective than English riding boots.</p><h2>Riding Style: English</h2><p>In the English riding style, the rider sits astride the horse in a straight or slightly curved position with the horse’s head facing forwards. The rider uses their legs to shift their weight and communicate with their horse. The English rider has their hands free, and uses a set of reins and a whip to guide the horse. The English riding instructor will tell you that the whip should only be used as a last resort. The horse is trained to respond to pressure on the saddle and pressure on the bit.The English saddle is larger than the Western saddle, and the English rider uses a stirrup that is much longer than that of the Western rider. The stirrup on an English horse is designed to help the rider maintain a balanced position in the saddle.</p><h2>Riding Style: Saddlebred</h2><p>Saddlebreds are a popular breed for riding instruction in the U.S. These horses are bred to be show-quality but easy to ride. Saddlebreds are known for their excellent movement and athleticism. Saddlebreds are usually ridden astride, and the rider uses a long, shallow saddle with a metal bar at the front of the seat to help keep the rider in place.The rider’s legs are free, and the rider uses a set of soft, flowing reins to communicate with the horse. Saddlebreds are bred to be very active and responsive to their rider’s cues. This riding style is best for people who love being in the middle of the action and want to participate in an active form of equestrian competition.</p><h2>Riding Style: Hunter/Jumper</h2><p>Hunter/Jumper is a popular equestrian sport that is often seen at horse shows. In this sport, the rider rides at a very fast speed, often over fences. The rider sits in a very shallow saddle and uses special equipment to help them stay in the saddle and keep the horse under control. The rider’s legs are free, and the horse is trained to respond to pressure on the bit.Jumping is one of the most exhilarating activities one can do on horseback, and is a great way to challenge yourself and test your riding abilities. To participate in jumping, you must have a horse that is trained in this sport.</p><h2>Riding Style: Dressage</h2><p>Dressage is an equestrian sport that is the combination of dress, competition, and art. The rider sits in a special saddle called a dressage saddle to help them communicate with their horse. The rider may use a special whip to help their horse perform certain tasks.Dressage is a very technical horse sport that requires years of training and practice. The rider sits very still in the saddle with their legs and body relaxed. The rider uses their hands to communicate with the horse.</p><h2>Riding Style: Road Horse or Trail Horse</h2><p>Road Horses are bred for speed, efficiency, and stamina. They are often used for pleasure rides or trail riding. Road Horses are usually ridden either one-handed with a loose rein or two-handed with a loose rein. Trail Horses are bred for endurance and trail riding. Trail Horses are usually ridden two-handed with a tight rein.Road Horses are bred for quick, short bursts of energy. Trail Horses are bred for long distance and endurance. Road Horses are used for trail rides, and Trail Horses are used for competitive trail riding. Road Horses are bred for short-distance trail rides, whereas Trail Horses are bred for longdistance trail rides.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>If you have read through this article, you now know about the different types of riding styles.
