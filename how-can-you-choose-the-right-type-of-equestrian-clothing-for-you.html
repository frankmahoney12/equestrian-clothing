                                                                                                    <p>When you first start riding, it can be intimidating buying your first set of protective gear. There are many different types of clothing available, and choosing the correct one for you can be challenging. If you’re new to the world of horseback riding, it’s important to understand the different types of clothing so that you can make the right choices for you. There are two main types of equestrian clothing: Competition wear and everyday wear. Both types of clothing are designed to protect you from hazards specific to each one—like competition jackets are made to protect you from the weather and dirt that can be kicked up when you’re competing, while everyday shirts are made to protect you from the dirt and sweat that build up when you’re working hard on the trail everyday. There are also different types of protective gear, like helmets for horseback riders.</p><h2>Competition wear</h2><p>Competitions are held throughout the year, making competition wear an important part of the rider’s wardrobe. Competing at a higher level means wearing more protective clothing, which is designed to keep you safe and comfortable.The two main types of competition clothing are coats and jackets. These garments are thicker and more protective than everyday coats and jackets, which means you can wear them in almost any weather.Coats are ideal for riding in cooler climates, while jackets are great for warmer weather. Both coats and jackets are made of thick materials that are designed to protect you from the elements, like high winds and falling branches.Coats and jackets are made to fit more like a suit, with slits in the sides to make it easier for you to move. They’re also often adjustable, so that you can make them fit perfectly by adjusting the side slits.A horseback rider’s coat should have long sleeves, long pants, and a full-length zipper, which makes it easier to put on and take off.It’s also important to note that a horseback rider’s coat has special pockets and other features that make it easier to keep your gear accessible. For example, some coats have an inside pocket that’s big enough to fit a water bottle, while others have special loops that make it easy to hang your helmet from your coat.</p><h2>Casual wear</h2><p>Casual wear is worn when you’re not riding, and it’s important to choose clothing that’s made to protect you. Since casual wear isn’t as protective as competition wear, it’s important to select clothing that doesn’t put you at risk.Casual wear is made to be breathable, so you can wear it when you’re working hard on the trail and sweating. It’s made with lighter, softer materials so you can move freely and comfortably.Casual wear is also often made out of stretchy materials that are easy to move in and out of. This is important because you’ll be working hard on the trail, and you don’t want to be wearing clothing that’s too tight or uncomfortable.Competition clothing often has more protective features than casual wear, like special pockets and zippers that keep your gear accessible. Casual clothing is designed to be breathable, comfortable, and low-maintenance, while competition clothing is made with more protective features.</p><h2>Protection and safety when choosing your clothing</h2><p>Protection - When choosing your clothing, it’s important to think about the hazards you’re most likely to face. If you’re riding in a competition, you’ll be wearing more protective clothing than you would be if you were just working on the trail and not competing.When you’re working on the trail, you’re likely to encounter hazards like branches, mud, and insects. You’ll also get sweaty from the effort you’re putting into riding, which can make you more susceptible to injuries. In these cases, it’s important to choose clothing that protects you from these hazards.When you’re riding in a competition, you’ll be facing additional hazards like flying branches, mud, and animals that could potentially injure you. In these cases, you’ll want to choose clothing that is more protective.When you’re choosing your clothing, it’s important to choose clothing that protects you from the hazards you’re most likely to encounter. You don’t want to wear clothing that’s too heavy or too restrictive, but you do want to make sure that it protects you from hazards like branches, mud, and insects that could cause you to get hurt.</p><h2>Helmets</h2><p>The most important piece of protective clothing you can wear when you’re riding is a helmet. It’s the only piece of protective clothing that protects your head from injuries.When you’re choosing a helmet, it’s important to choose one that fits you properly. A helmet that doesn’t fit right can cause you to be more likely to suffer an injury.To choose the right helmet, you’ll want to consider your head size and your riding style.The most important measurement when it comes to choosing the right helmet is your head size. You can measure your head size by following these simple instructions: 1) Find a measuring tape, 2) Find a place on your head that’s not hairy and won’t irritate your skin, 3) Make sure the tape is securely wrapped around your head, and 4) Use the tape to measure the length of your head from the top of your head to the place where your head meets your neck.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Whether you’re just getting started or you’re an experienced rider, it’s important to choose the right type of clothing for you. Competition wear and casual wear have different features, like pockets, zippers, and breathability, which make it easier to keep your gear accessible. When choosing clothing, it’s important to choose clothing that protects you from the hazards you’re most likely to encounter.You also need to make sure that the clothing you choose is comfortable enough for you to wear all day, every day. If you’re wearing clothing that’s too heavy or restrictive, you may be less likely to want to ride.If you’re new to the world of horseback riding, it’s important to understand the different types of clothing so that you can make the right choices for you.
