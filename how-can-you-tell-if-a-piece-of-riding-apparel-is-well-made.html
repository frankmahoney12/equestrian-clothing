In order to find something that’s comfortable and fits properly, you might have to try out several different pieces. That doesn’t mean they don’t care about your comfort or fit, but it does mean that you have to be selective about what you choose. Even if you find something that you like, it’s important to remember that quality comes at a price and not all riding apparel is created equal. When shopping for apparel, there are a few things to keep in mind before you make your final decision. The quality of your clothes is key, along with the materials they are made from and the construction of the garments. Below are some helpful tips on how to tell if a piece of riding apparel is well-made.</p><h2>Look for details and construction.</h2><p>One of the first things you should check when looking at a piece of clothing is the attention to detail. Look for stitching that is even, consistent, and just as thick in the seams. Look at the stress points and make sure they aren’t frayed or thin in any areas. The more attention to detail a garment has, the more likely it is to hold up longer and be more comfortable.Quality fabrics are another important factor when it comes to clothes. You want to look for fabrics that are breathable and moisture wicking. Not only will these fabrics keep you cooler and drier, but they will also last longer and be more durable. The materials used in construction are also important. You want to make sure that the garments are constructed with proper seams and panels, and that they don’t have loose threads hanging out.Loose threads can get caught in your horse’s hooves, stirrup straps, and tack and cause irritation. It can also lead to other issues, like chafing, if your horse is moving around a lot. If you see loose threads, that tells you that the garment was not constructed properly and might need to be replaced.</p><h2>Check the fit.</h2><p>The fit of a garment is an important part of the overall quality, especially if it’s something that you’re going to be wearing all day. You’ll want to make sure that the length of the garment is long enough and that it isn’t too short. You’ll probably want the cuffs to be at or above the bend of your wrist, depending on your personal preference.If you are wearing a jacket, you’ll also want to make sure that the sleeves are long enough. Depending on the type of jacket, you may want to get one with adjustable cuffs. You can also get jackets without sleeves if they are appropriate for your type of riding.</p><h2>Check the stitching and seams.</h2><p>If you want to make sure that the fabrics are holding up as they should be, you’ll want to check the stitching and seams. Make sure that the stitching is even, consistent, and just as thick in the seams as it is around the rest of the garment. As we mentioned before, loose threads can lead to irritation, so you want to make sure that there aren’t any floating loose ends. You may also want to check for loose tags, tags that have come undone, and tags that have been sewn onto garments that they shouldn’t be attached to.Some fabrics have tags on them, but some don’t. When tags are present, they should be sewn onto the garment. When they aren’t, they can become a trip hazard or get caught in your equipment. You may also want to check the seams. The seams of good quality garments won’t unravel, they’ll just fray.</p><h2>Watch out for branding and logos.</h2><p>Branding and logos are a big part of almost every clothing and accessory brand. While they are a good way to advertise and get your brand out there, they can also be a hazard to your horse.For example, if you’re riding in a show, you’ll want to make sure that your stirrup straps are secured. The stirrup strap used on some branded garments are thin and don’t provide much support. They can also get caught in your stirrup causing discomfort.If you have a logo on a garment, it can also get caught in your stirrup and cause irritation.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>When shopping for equestrian-specific clothing, there are a lot of options available.
