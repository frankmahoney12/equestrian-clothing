                                                                                                    <p>Equestrian clothing is more than just a fancy name for horse riding attire. In fact, as an occupation, riding has one of the highest rates of injury in sports. That’s why it’s so important for equestrians to wear protective clothing and gear that will not only keep them safe but also allow them to perform at their best. Luckily, there are a wide variety of different types of equestrian clothing available today. Whether you’re an amateur rider looking for some basic protective gear to protect you during practice or an advanced rider who needs something more specialized for competitions or trail rides, there’s something for everyone. Let’s take a look at some of the most common types of equestrian clothing used for riding:</p><h2>Jumpers</h2><p>Jumpers are the most basic type of equestrian clothing and are often worn when you’re just getting started with horse riding. They come in many different styles, so you can find something that matches your personal style.A typical jumper is made from a combination of mesh, leather, and synthetic materials. This type of clothing is not only functional but also very stylish. It’s a great choice for beginners who are just getting started with horseback riding and want something that will protect them from scratches and minor injuries while also being trendy enough to wear on a regular basis.The most important part of any jumper is the pants. They should be made of either mesh or leather, with a synthetic upper layer. It’s not necessary for the jacket to be made of mesh or synthetic material, but it’s a good idea to have it be made of a more protective material. This will make it easier to clean and prevent stains.</p><h2>Western-style jackets and coats</h2><p>Western-style jackets and coats are designed to be worn over your other equestrian clothing, such as a riding shirt or a pair of chaps. The jacket is typically made of leather, although it can also be made of synthetic materials that are more breathable.These jackets are usually made to be worn over a dress shirt, as opposed to a shirt made for equestrian use. Western-style jackets are designed to be functional and protect you as well as keep you warm and dry. They’re typically made with the same type of materials as the rest of your equestrian clothing, such as leather for the jacket and synthetic materials for the pants.</p><h2>Full-sleeve riding shirts and jerseys</h2><p>Full-sleeve riding shirts and jerseys are made to be worn over a jacket or jacket-style top, and they protect the arms and shoulders. These tops are often made with a mesh lining and a synthetic layer on top.Full-sleeve tops are designed to protect the arms and shoulders from sun and rain, as well as provide more warmth than a jersey. They’re particularly useful during cold weather or when you’re riding in wet conditions where you need more protection.Full-sleeve jerseys are made for indoor riding, but they can be used for outdoor riding as well if they’re made with a waterproof membrane.They’re often made with the same type of materials as the rest of your equestrian clothing, such as leather for the jacket and synthetic materials for the top. Full-sleeve jerseys are an excellent choice for both novice and advanced riders.</p><h2>Riding pants</h2><p>Riding pants are basically the same thing as shorts, but they’re designed to be worn over riding boots. These pants protect the lower part of your leg and are often made of leather or synthetic materials.Riding pants are made to be worn over a pair of riding boots, and they protect your legs from sun, insects, and scratches. They’re particularly useful for trail riding or when you’re around other horses.Riding pants are often made with the same types of materials as the rest of your equestrian clothing, such as leather for the jacket and synthetic materials for the pants.</p><h2>Breastplates and leg shields</h2><p>Breastplates and leg shields are designed to protect the most sensitive parts of your body during riding. Breastplates are designed to protect the chest and stomach, while leg shields protect the legs and lower body.Breastplates are commonly made of leather, while leg shields are often made of synthetic materials. Both breastplates and leg shields are typically available in a variety of different designs, so you can find something that matches your style.Breastplates and leg shields are useful for trail riding, jumping, and other types of advanced riding, and they’re also great for beginners who may not be able to handle as much abuse as they would like to put their bodies through. They’re an excellent investment for serious horseback riders who want to protect their bodies from the abuse they might receive during practice and competition.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Equestrian clothing is an important part of horse riding, and it’s important to make sure you have the right protective gear to keep you safe while you’re out on the trail or at the stable. There are many different types of equestrian clothing available today, so no matter what your experience level is, you can find something that will protect you while you ride.If you’re just getting started with horse riding, a jumper is a good choice for its simplicity and affordability. It’s not necessary to spend a lot of money on your first pair of equestrian clothing, but it’s important to find something that’s functional and protects you as best it can. As you gain experience, you can move on to more specialized clothing that will better suit your needs.</p>
