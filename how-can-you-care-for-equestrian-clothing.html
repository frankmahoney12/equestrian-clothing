Between coats, breeches, jackets, helmets and boots there’s plenty to think about – not to mention choosing the right fabrics and colours to suit your personal taste and needs. However, with the right knowledge, these things become much simpler to understand and manage. Luckily, equestrians are well equipped to care for their clothing thanks to many different types of materials and construction used when making these items. We’ll take a look at this in more detail below and explain how you can customize your horse’s garments to suit your personal style and needs. There is also some general advice on caring for different fabrics used for equestrian clothing.</p><h2>Coats</h2><p>A coat is the most important piece of equestrian clothing in terms of functionality. It should be waterproof, warm and protect the horse’s legs. You’ll want to choose a waterproof fabric that is breathable and windproof, and a fabric that can handle both extremes of temperature without letting the horse get too hot or too cold. A good coat will also have adjustable cuffs and a pocket or two for storing essential equipment such as a grooming brush or hoof pick. When cleaning your horse’s coat, you’ll first want to remove any dirt and debris with a natural bristle brush. You can then use a conditioner or an enzymatic detergent, followed by careful drying with a horse-hair dryer. Be sure to check the label to make sure the product you’re using is safe for your horse’s coat.</p><h2>Breeches</h2><p>The next piece of equestrian clothing to consider is the breeches or horse trousers. You’ll want these to be waterproof, breathable, durable and comfortable – and fit your horse properly. A good pair of breeches should be long enough to come to just above your horse’s hoof and be roomy enough to accommodate the area around the crotch and hocks. Depending on the type of riding you do, you may want to choose a more supportive or stretchy fabric for your breeches. For example, when jumping or working with high-impact activities such as hunt or eventing, you’ll want to look for a material that can stretch to accommodate the added pressure. For other activities, you may want a stiffer fabric that offers more support and doesn’t stretch as much. In addition to waterproof fabrics, you’ll want to choose a breathable one to trap body heat, reduce moisture and help regulate body temperature. A good choice for a breathable fabric is a synthetic one.</p><h2>Tack</h2><p>The next thing to consider when it comes to equestrian clothing is your horse’s tack. A good rule of thumb is that one good pair of stirrups will last a lifetime and go with everything you own. When purchasing new riding gear, you’ll want to make sure you get high-quality, well-made items that will last for years. You’ll want to select pieces that fit properly and are made with high-quality materials. For example, you may want to choose a pair of English-style spurs that are made from high-quality stainless steel, while your bridle may be made from lightweight and flexible synthetic materials. To clean your horse’s tack, start by using a mild soap and water. Then, use a horse-hair dryer to remove the soap and any other residue. When cleaning leather items, such as your horse’s bridle, you’ll want to use a leather cleaner. This will help prevent bacteria build-up and preserve the leather’s natural oils.</p><h2>Saddles and Seats</h2><p>When it comes to your horse’s tack, you may also want to consider the type of seat or saddle you choose. There are many different styles and materials to consider when purchasing a new seat or saddle, including wood, synthetic and steel. Depending on what you like and what you intend to use your seat or saddle for, you may want to choose a particular type of material. For example, a more traditional style of seat may be constructed from wood, while a more modern version may be made from synthetic materials. Saddles may also be constructed from a variety of different materials, including plastic and metal. When cleaning your horse’s seat, start by removing any visible dirt and debris with a horse-hair dryer. Then, use a cleaning solution to remove any stubborn stains and residue.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The final thing to consider when it comes to equestrian clothing is how to accessorize. A good rule of thumb is to choose items that allow you to personalize your look so you can express your own style. For example, you may want to select a colour or pattern that matches your riding attire or a special event. In addition, you may want to select items that are lightweight enough to stay on for long periods of time without causing you to tire out. When it comes to equestrian clothing, the best way to get started is to familiarize yourself with the materials and construction used for these items. Once you know what to look for, caring for your clothing will become much simpler.</p>
