While it is important to look for quality equestrian clothing that will help you perform better on the horse, it is also important to know how to make these items work for you. Whether you are just getting started with dressage or you’re an experienced rider looking for a change of pace, there are some things you need to know about equestrian fashion before you hit the show ring. In this blog post, we’ll go over everything from the best fabrics for the warmer months to choosing the right helmet for your head.If you’re ready to learn more about equestrian clothing and the best way to make it work for you, keep reading!</p><h2>Know what you need for your body type</h2><p>The best way to make equestrian clothing work for you is to understand your body type and what pieces will help you the most. For example, some riders prefer a loose and roomy fit while others prefer a more tailored feel. Depending on your size, the overall fit of the clothing will vary.While there are multiple factors that determine the best fit for your body type, the most important is your torso length. Try measuring your torso length by placing a measuring tape around your torso at the location where pants normally start. If you have a long torso, you will generally want to choose pants that are longer in length than pants that are designed for someone who has a shorter torso.While torso length is the most important factor, there are several other things to keep in mind when shopping for equestrian clothing.</p><h2>Know the different fabrics and materials</h2><p>Depending on the season, there are several different fabrics and materials you can choose for your equestrian clothing. While wool is a great choice for warmer months, cotton is a good option for most parts of the year.For warm-weather months (October through May), wool is a great option for your equestrian clothing. Wool is an extremely warm and soft fabric that stays soft and smooth even when it gets wet. When paired with a rain jacket, wool can also help protect against UV light.While most people associate wool with cold weather, it is actually a very warm fabric.The only downside to wool is that it is often not as breathable as other fabrics. If you find yourself in very warm weather, it might be best to choose a fabric that is slightly less heavy for a more breathable option.</p><h2>Pick the right fit for your horse</h2><p>While it is important to understand what fabrics and materials to use for your equestrian clothing, it is also important to know how these items will fit your horse.Depending on the type of clothing you are wearing, it might be important to choose a certain fit. For example, a skirt or a pair of leggings will usually require a more form-fitting fit.Depending on the type of fabric used, not all fabrics will require the same type of fit. For example, wool is an incredibly warm fabric, so it can be tricky to find a pair of leggings that are not too thick in the winter months. If you’re unsure about the fit of your equestrian clothing, it is best to try it on before you buy it.It is also important to remember that your horse might not be wearing the same type of clothing you are. Depending on the discipline you are riding, your horse might have a different type of clothing. While you might be rocking a pair of leggings and a long shirt for dressage, your show jumper might be wearing short socks, a short-sleeved shirt, and a pair of short stirrup pants.</p><h2>Don’t forget the helmet!</h2><p>While it might not seem like something that needs mentioning, don’t forget to choose the right helmet for your equestrian clothing. While it is important to choose a helmet that fits your head, it is also important to make sure it is compatible with the fabrics in your clothing.Depending on the type of fabrics you are wearing, you might not be able to use a helmet that is made out of leather. If you are wearing a fabric that is made out of synthetic materials, it might not be compatible with a leather helmet.The best way to find out if a certain helmet will work with your equestrian clothing is to try it on. You can also ask the salesperson if you can try out the helmet on some of the fabrics in your clothing before purchasing it.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Equestrian clothing is a great way to show off your love for horses. However, it can be challenging to choose the right items to make sure you look your best. Whether you are shopping for your first pair of dressage boots or you are going to the horse show to win your first blue ribbon, it is important to know what to look for. While you’re shopping for equestrian clothing, make sure you choose fabrics that are breathable and comfortable for all types of weather.</p>
